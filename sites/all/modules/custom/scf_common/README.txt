SCF Common feature holds generic settings that all SCF sites are likely to want
to use.

Nice menus: we use context for placing blocks on the site, but the settings
of nice menus are only accessible by editing the block settings in the core
UI, even if the core UI does not place the block anywhere. Direct link:
